# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For this project, the goal was to make a mobile-ready web application from a static webpage. It was required to make it responsive, accessible for screen reader users and reachable when there was no internet.

### How to display the application?

You will need to:

1. Install Python if it's not already done (check [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for documentation).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Enter `python -m SimpleTTPServer 8000` if your version of Python is 2. Enter `Python -m http.server 8000` if your version is Python 3.
4. Open a browser and type `http://localhost:8000`.

The starter code (Google Maps version) for this project is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1/tree/google-maps). I visited [this site](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers) for help with the Service Worker. I also watched [this walkthrough] by Mohamed Riaad for help with CSS issues.
